# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Flight Information Rendering System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the UI components to display flight-specific data received through the mesh network.
# Details:
Create a rendering pipeline to process and display flight information with appropriate visual hierarchy. Implement high-contrast UI components optimized for variable ambient lighting conditions. Develop chronological indicators for message age and freshness. Create visual indicators for active scanning state, connection attempts, and successful fetches. Implement multi-modal alerts using audio and haptic feedback for priority messages. Design the message list visualization with sorting and filtering capabilities. Create specialized display components for different message types (gate changes, boarding announcements, delays, etc.).

# Test Strategy:
Test UI rendering with various message types and priorities. Verify visual hierarchy correctly emphasizes critical information. Test accessibility features and contrast ratios. Validate chronological indicators for accuracy. Test multi-modal alerts on different device types. Perform usability testing with simulated airport scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Core Rendering Pipeline and Data Models [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundational rendering pipeline that processes flight data from the mesh network and prepares it for display
### Details:
Implement a data processing layer that handles incoming flight information, normalizes it, and prepares it for rendering. Create data models for different message types (gate changes, boarding, delays, etc.). Design the pipeline to handle message prioritization based on urgency and relevance. Include timestamp processing for chronological tracking. This subtask focuses on the data processing backbone before any UI components are built.

## 2. Implement Base UI Components with High-Contrast Design [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop the core UI components optimized for variable lighting conditions with appropriate visual hierarchy
### Details:
Create reusable UI components including message cards, status indicators, and information panels. Implement high-contrast design patterns with appropriate color schemes, typography, and spacing for readability in various lighting conditions. Design components to be responsive to different screen sizes and orientations. Include visual hierarchy indicators to distinguish between critical, important, and standard messages. Test components under different simulated lighting conditions.

## 3. Develop Message List Visualization with Sorting and Filtering [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Create the main message list interface with chronological indicators and filtering capabilities
### Details:
Implement the primary message list view that displays processed flight information. Add chronological indicators showing message age and freshness. Create sorting options (by time, priority, flight, etc.) and filtering capabilities (by message type, status, etc.). Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for handling large message volumes. Include search functionality to quickly locate specific information. Design should follow the visual hierarchy established in subtask 2.

## 4. Implement Network Status Indicators and Connection Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create visual indicators for mesh network activity and connection states
### Details:
Develop UI components that display the current state of the mesh network. Implement visual indicators for active scanning, connection attempts, and successful data fetches. Create animations or progress indicators that provide real-time feedback on network operations. Design error states and recovery indicators when network issues occur. Ensure these indicators are visible but non-intrusive to the main flight information display.

## 5. Integrate Multi-Modal Alerts and Specialized Message Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Implement audio/haptic feedback system and specialized display components for different message types
### Details:
Develop the multi-modal alert system that triggers audio and haptic feedback for priority messages. Create specialized display components for different message types (gate changes, boarding announcements, delays, etc.) with appropriate visual treatments. Implement the alert priority system that determines when to trigger multi-modal feedback. Design the alert dismissal and acknowledgment flow. Ensure all components integrate seamlessly with the main message list and network status indicators developed in previous subtasks.
