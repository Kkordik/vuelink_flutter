# Title: Implement Message Composition Interface (Android)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop the interface for airline personnel to create and originate messages on Android devices.
# Details:
Create an authenticated interface for airline personnel to compose and transmit messages. Implement flight identifier selection with search/filtering. Develop message classification selection UI. Create input forms for minimal payload content with character count limitations. Implement confirmation flow and transmission initiation. Develop templated message composition system for common scenarios. Create preview functionality to show how the message will appear to recipients. Implement scheduled message transmission capability for future broadcasts.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flow for airline personnel. Verify flight identifier selection and filtering. Test message composition with various content lengths and types. Validate template system for common message scenarios. Test scheduled message functionality for accuracy. Perform usability testing with airline personnel to validate workflow efficiency.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Authentication and Basic Message Composition UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the authenticated interface foundation and basic message composition screen for airline personnel
### Details:
Develop the login/authentication flow for airline personnel. Create the basic message composition screen with a clean, intuitive layout. Implement the flight identifier selection component with search and filtering capabilities. Add input validation to ensure only authorized personnel can access the composition interface. Use Material Design components for consistent Android UI. Structure the layout to accommodate all planned message composition elements that will be added in subsequent tasks.

## 2. Implement Message Classification and Content Input [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Add message classification selection and content input forms with character limitations
### Details:
Create a dropdown or radio button UI for message classification selection (e.g., urgent, informational, safety). Implement input forms for message content with appropriate character count limitations and real-time validation. Add visual indicators for remaining character count. Ensure the UI adapts to different message types, showing only relevant fields based on classification. Implement input masking and validation for specialized fields. Create error states and helpful validation messages for user feedback.

## 3. Develop Message Templates and Preview Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create a templated message system and message preview capability
### Details:
Implement a template selection system for common message scenarios (e.g., delays, gate changes, boarding). Create template management functionality to save, edit and delete templates. Develop a message preview component that accurately displays how the message will appear to recipients on their devices. Ensure the preview updates in real-time as the user edits the message. Add the ability to switch between different recipient device views in the preview. Implement a way to save draft messages for later completion.

## 4. Implement Confirmation Flow and Scheduled Transmission [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Add message confirmation process and scheduled message capabilities
### Details:
Create a confirmation dialog that summarizes the message details before transmission. Implement immediate transmission functionality with progress indication and success/failure states. Develop scheduled message transmission capability with date/time picker. Add a scheduled messages queue view to see pending transmissions. Implement the ability to edit or cancel scheduled messages. Create notification system for successful/failed transmissions. Add analytics tracking for message composition and transmission events.
