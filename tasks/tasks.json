Create an automatic power-saving mode that activates at configurable battery thresholds (default 20%). Implement override options for critical operations. Add user notifications when entering power-saving mode. Develop environment fingerprinting to remember optimal scan settings for frequently visited locations. Implement graceful recovery when battery is recharged. Test in various real-world environments to validate adaptive behavior."
