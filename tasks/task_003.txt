# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Message Parsing and Reassembly System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop functionality to parse, validate, and reassemble multi-part messages received through BLE advertisements.
# Details:
Create a message parsing system that can identify and process different message types from BLE advertisements. Implement a reassembly mechanism for multi-part messages that tracks message parts, validates completeness, and reconstructs the original payload. Develop validation logic to ensure message integrity and handle corrupted or missing parts. Create a message cache to track recently seen messages and prevent duplicate processing. Implement timeout handling for incomplete multi-part messages.

# Test Strategy:
Test parsing of all message types from raw advertisement data. Verify reassembly of multi-part messages with various payload sizes. Test handling of out-of-order message parts. Validate timeout behavior for incomplete messages. Test deduplication logic with repeated messages.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement message type identification and parsing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functionality to identify message types from advertisement data and parse them into appropriate data structures
### Details:
Develop a MessageParser class that can identify the four message types from raw advertisement data. Implement type-specific parsing logic for each message format. Create data validation to ensure required fields are present and valid. Implement error handling for malformed messages. Create unit tests with sample advertisement data for each message type. Integrate with the BLE scanning system to process incoming advertisements automatically.

## 2. Develop multi-part message tracking and reassembly [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a system to track parts of multi-part messages and reassemble them when complete
### Details:
Implement a MessageReassembler class that tracks parts of multi-part messages by message ID. Create data structures to store message parts until all are received. Implement part validation to ensure correct sequence and prevent duplicates. Add timeout handling to clean up incomplete messages after a configurable period. Create callbacks to notify when complete messages are assembled. Implement error handling for missing or corrupted parts. Add logging for reassembly process debugging.

## 3. Implement message deduplication and caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a caching system to track seen messages and prevent duplicate processing
### Details:
Develop a MessageCache class that stores recently seen message IDs. Implement time-based cache expiration to manage memory usage. Create efficient lookup methods to quickly check if a message has been seen before. Add configuration options for cache size and expiration time. Implement thread-safe operations for concurrent access. Create metrics to track cache hit/miss rates. Test with high message volumes to ensure performance.

## 4. Implement message validation and integrity checking [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Create robust validation logic to ensure message integrity and handle corrupted data
### Details:
Implement comprehensive validation for each message type to ensure data integrity. Create checksum or hash verification if included in the message format. Implement field validation for expected ranges and formats. Add handling for corrupted or invalid messages. Create a validation reporting system to track and analyze validation failures. Implement graceful degradation for partially valid messages. Test with deliberately corrupted data to verify error handling.

## 5. Develop message processing pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Create an end-to-end processing pipeline that handles messages from reception through parsing, validation, and delivery
### Details:
Implement a MessageProcessor class that orchestrates the entire message handling pipeline. Create a queue-based processing system to handle high message volumes. Implement priority handling for different message types. Add hooks for message-type-specific processing logic. Create a comprehensive event system to notify application components about new messages. Implement error handling and recovery at each pipeline stage. Add performance metrics to identify bottlenecks. Test the complete pipeline with various message scenarios.
