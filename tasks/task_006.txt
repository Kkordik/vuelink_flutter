# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Message Forwarding System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the functionality to forward received messages to other devices based on message flags and configuration.
# Details:
Implement logic for devices to forward received messages based on repeat flags and configuration settings. Create a message deduplication system to prevent forwarding loops. Implement configurable forwarding limits including hop count and time-to-live. Develop intelligent forwarding that considers network density and battery level. Create analytics to track message propagation through the network. Add user configuration options to control forwarding behavior.

# Test Strategy:
Test forwarding behavior with various message types and repeat flags. Verify deduplication prevents forwarding loops. Test hop count and TTL limits are respected. Measure forwarding performance in different network densities. Validate that forwarding respects user configuration settings.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design forwarding configuration system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a configuration system that allows controlling message forwarding behavior with appropriate default settings.
### Details:
Implement a ForwardingConfig class with properties for: enabled/disabled state, maximum hop count, time-to-live, and forwarding delay. Create platform-specific default configurations recognizing iOS and Android capabilities. Add this to the app's settings interface with appropriate toggles and explanations of power/network impact. Include detection logic for network density to provide recommendations on optimal settings.

## 2. Implement message deduplication system [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a system to track seen messages and prevent forwarding loops.
### Details:
Develop a MessageTracker class that maintains a cache of recently seen message IDs. Implement efficient lookup to quickly determine if a message has been seen before. Create time-based expiration to manage cache size. Add metrics to track duplicate detection rates. Implement thread-safe operations for concurrent access. Test with simulated network scenarios to verify loop prevention.

## 3. Develop message forwarding logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create the core functionality to forward messages based on repeat flags and configuration.
### Details:
Implement a MessageForwarder class that processes received messages and determines if they should be forwarded. Create logic to check repeat flags and only forward messages marked for repetition. Implement hop count tracking and enforcement of maximum hops. Add time-to-live checking to prevent forwarding expired messages. Create a forwarding queue to manage pending transmissions. Implement random delay before forwarding to reduce collision probability.

## 4. Implement intelligent forwarding optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Create adaptive forwarding behavior based on network conditions and device state.
### Details:
Develop a NetworkDensityMonitor that estimates local network density based on received message volume. Implement adaptive forwarding that reduces probability in dense networks. Create battery-aware forwarding that reduces activity at low battery levels. Implement priority-based forwarding that ensures important messages are forwarded even under restrictions. Add analytics to measure forwarding effectiveness and network propagation patterns.

## 5. Create forwarding analytics and visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Develop tools to track and visualize message propagation through the network.
### Details:
Implement a ForwardingAnalytics class that tracks message propagation metrics. Create visualizations showing message spread through the network. Add metrics for forwarding efficiency, network density, and battery impact. Implement debug logging for forwarding decisions. Create a developer dashboard to monitor forwarding behavior in real-time. Add export functionality for offline analysis of forwarding patterns.
