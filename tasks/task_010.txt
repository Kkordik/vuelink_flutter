# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Power Optimization and Configuration Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop power management features and user configuration options to optimize battery usage.
# Details:
Implement power consumption monitoring for BLE operations using the chosen BLE libraries (flutter_blue_plus, flutter_reactive_ble, etc.). Create user configuration options for scan intensity (aggressive, balanced, power-saving). Develop adaptive duty cycles for scanning based on battery level and user settings. Implement background execution optimizations within platform limits. Create power usage analytics to show BLE operation impact. Develop intelligent scanning that adjusts based on environment (e.g., reducing scan frequency in low-density scenarios). Implement power-saving mode that activates automatically at low battery levels.

# Test Strategy:
Measure power consumption under different scan configurations. Test adaptive duty cycles with various battery levels. Verify background execution behavior on both platforms. Test power-saving mode activation and its impact on functionality. Validate that user configuration changes properly affect scanning behavior. Perform long-duration testing to measure battery impact over extended periods.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement BLE Power Consumption Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to measure and track power consumption of BLE operations
### Details:
Develop a service that monitors power usage during BLE operations (scanning, connecting, data transfer). Implement hooks into the chosen BLE library (flutter_blue_plus or flutter_reactive_ble) to track operation duration and frequency. Create a data structure to store power consumption metrics with timestamps. Implement background monitoring that works within platform constraints. Test on multiple device types to establish baseline power consumption profiles.

## 2. Develop User Configuration Interface for Power Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create UI components allowing users to configure power usage preferences
### Details:
Design and implement a settings screen with options for scan intensity (aggressive, balanced, power-saving). Add toggles for background scanning behavior. Create sliders or presets for scan frequency and duration. Implement persistence for user preferences using shared_preferences or similar. Add explanatory text for each option describing the power/performance tradeoffs. Include a reset to defaults option. Ensure settings are applied immediately when changed.

## 3. Implement Adaptive Duty Cycles Based on Battery and Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create algorithms that adjust BLE scanning patterns based on battery level and user preferences
### Details:
Implement battery level monitoring using platform-specific APIs. Create duty cycle profiles for different battery levels (e.g., 100-75%, 74-50%, 49-25%, <25%). Develop algorithms that adjust scan frequency, duration, and interval based on the selected user power profile and current battery level. Implement graceful degradation of scan intensity as battery depletes. Add event listeners to detect and respond to battery level changes in real-time. Test extensively to ensure proper balance between functionality and power saving.

## 4. Develop Power Usage Analytics Dashboard [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.3
### Description: Create visualizations showing BLE operation impact on battery consumption
### Details:
Design and implement a power analytics dashboard UI. Create charts showing BLE power consumption over time. Add metrics for scan frequency, duration, and power impact. Implement comparisons between different power profiles. Show estimated battery savings from current settings. Create historical views of power usage patterns. Add export functionality for power usage data. Ensure analytics are updated in real-time as BLE operations occur.

## 5. Implement Intelligent Scanning and Automatic Power-Saving Mode [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Create advanced scanning algorithms that adapt to environment and implement automatic power-saving at low battery
### Details:
Develop logic to detect BLE device density in the environment. Implement algorithms that reduce scan frequency in low-density scenarios. Create an automatic power-saving mode that activates at configurable battery thresholds (default 20%). Implement override options for critical operations. Add user notifications when entering power-saving mode. Develop environment fingerprinting to remember optimal scan settings for frequently visited locations. Implement graceful recovery when battery is recharged. Test in various real-world environments to validate adaptive behavior.
